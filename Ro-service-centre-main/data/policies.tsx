        <p>Welcome to RO Service Centre Online. By accessing our website and booking our services, you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Bookings and Technician Visits</h2>
        <p>We strive to provide technician visits within 60-90 minutes across our Bangalore service areas. However, arrival times may vary based on traffic, weather conditions, and technician availability. Service hours are 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM, all 7 days.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Charges and Estimates</h2>
        <p>A standard visiting/inspection charge applies if you decide not to proceed with the repair after diagnosis. If you proceed with the repair, the visiting charge is usually waived or adjusted against the final bill. Our technicians will provide an estimate for spare parts before commencing the repair.</p>
        
        <h2>Spare Parts and Warranties</h2>
        <p>We use genuine or high-quality compatible spare parts. Warranties on spare parts (like RO membranes, pumps, and SMPS) are provided as per the manufacturer's terms or our stated service guarantee. Consumable filters typically do not carry a long-term warranty due to varying water quality (TDS) in Bangalore.</p>
        
        <h2>Limitations of Service</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to refuse service if the work environment is deemed unsafe or if the water purifier is beyond repair. We are not liable for pre-existing damages to the appliance or plumbing.</p>

        <h2>Contact & Support</h2>
        <p>For questions or service inquiries regarding these terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Contect@Roservicecentreonline24x7.in" className="text-[#1a62d6] underline">Contect@Roservicecentreonline24x7.in</a>, call 08050291180, or write to No. 97, Neeladri Nagar, Electronics City Phase 1 Extension, Bengaluru, Karnataka.</p>

        <p>This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the terms regarding the cancellation of service bookings and refund eligibility at RO Service Centre Online.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Cancellation</h2>
        <p>You may cancel or reschedule your service booking at any time before the technician is dispatched to your location without any cancellation fee.

        <h2>Technician Visits</h2>
        <p>If the technician has arrived at your location and you choose to cancel the repair after diagnosis, a nominal inspection/visiting fee will be applicable for their time and travel.</p>
        
        <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>We do not collect advance payments for standard repair services. Payment is due upon completion of the service and your satisfaction. Therefore, refunds are generally not applicable for labor charges.</p>
        <p>If a spare part replaced by us fails within its specified warranty period, we will replace the part free of charge. No cash refunds will be provided for installed spare parts or filters.</p>
